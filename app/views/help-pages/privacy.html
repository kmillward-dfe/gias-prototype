        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            Get Information about School's (GIAS) is a digital service operated by the Department for Education (DfE).
            As the department's official repository and 'source of truth' for schools and colleges, this service enables
            users to a) find information about education establishments within England and Wales; and b) allows
            establishments to update their details. For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data
            controller for the personal data processed as part of GIAS.
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy sets out how we collect and process your personal data for the GIAS digital service.
            This policy applies to all users of the GIAS digital service ('you').
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we will use your information</h2>
        <p>
            As part of GIAS we receive your personal data from early years and compulsory school age establishments,
            further and higher education institutions, local authorities and academy trusts. DfE processes your data to
            compile and maintain the official register of educational establishments in England and Wales for internal
            use and as a source of reference by the education sector and general public.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The nature of your personal data we will be using</h2>
        <p>
            We may use the following personal information for GIAS:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>head teachers/principals/managers and governance roles name and contact details</li>
            <li>authorised and public user's internet protocol address (IP)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h2>
        <p>
            In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the
            data protection legislation. For the purpose of this project, the relevant condition(s) that we are meeting
            are as set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the UK GPDR in that processing of your information is necessary for the
            exercise of the function of the department.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is stored</h2>
        <p>
            The DfE holds and processes personal information within the United Kingdom (UK) and under contracted
            services, within the European Economic Area (EEA). Where we process your information outside of the UK, we
            ensure that our service providers take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in
            line with our policies and legal requirements.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we will keep your personal data</h2>
        <p>
            We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purpose(s) of this piece of work,
            after which point it will be securely destroyed. Please note that, under data protection legislation, and in
            compliance with the relevant data processing conditions, personal data can be kept for longer periods of
            time when processed purely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research,
            and statistical purposes. Non-public personal data is subject to a 6 year retention policy and is then
            reviewed annually.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing your personal information with others</h2>
        <p>
            We may share information we hold about you with certain organisations where the law allows it, or if we have
            a legal obligation to do so. We may share information with other organisations, including the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>national and local agencies who look after children</li>
            <li>local authorities</li>
            <li>professionals who work in early years, schools and further and higher education institutions, children's
                services and health services</li>
            <li>other government departments and related public-sector bodies</li>
            <li>research institutions</li>
            <li>organisations contracted with us and/or by the above organisations to undertake work for them, requiring
                them to manage your information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There may be some circumstances where we will need to share information about you with others without your
            consent. For example, this might be to prevent or detect a crime, or to comply with our obligations under
            safeguarding laws. In all cases, we will comply with all information handling legislation including the Data
            Protection Act 2018.
        </p>
