                                <p>Academies are publicly funded independent schools. They don’t have to follow the
                                    national curriculum and can set their own term times. They still have to follow the
                                    same rules on admissions, special educational needs and exclusions as other state
                                    schools. Academies get money directly from the government, not the local council.
                                    They’re run by an academy trust which employs the staff. Some academies have
                                    sponsors such as businesses, universities, other schools, faith groups or voluntary
                                    groups. Sponsors are responsible for improving the performance of their schools.</p>

                            <div class="gias-user-content"><p>The term online provider refers to a provider of online
                                education services which operates online-only on a permanent basis, delivering a
                                full-time education, a full curriculum, and representing at least one child's main
                                source of education.

                                Online providers are registered under the online education accreditation scheme. To be
                                eligible for the scheme, an online provider must have at least one learner of compulsory
                                school age in England. The scheme is restricted only to online providers that are
                                registered in the UK with Companies House or the Charity Commission.

                                Where we refer to a 'provider', we are referring to a provider of online education
                                services. The term is not to be interpreted as meaning a provider of education under the
                                Education and Skills Act 2008 or any other relevant Act.

                                Providers of online education services will often be commissioned services that hold
                                responsibility for the delivery of education services only; other education providers,
                                such as independent schools, may have additional responsibilities as a result of their
                                operation from physical premises and the physical presence of pupils. Establishments
                                delivering remote education, such as online classes, resulting from the COVID-19
                                pandemic, are not impacted by the online education accreditation scheme as they are not
                                categorised as this establishment type. </p>
